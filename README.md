GlowBand is an exciting LED wristband. For dancing at parties and festivals, for long-time exposure photography, and for everyday situations that need some light.

This project started as "The Glowing Arms Project" (check out the "GlowBand v0.1" folder) and after experimenting with making the project smaller and based on existing PCBs ("GlowBand v0.2" folder) I decided to instead make a custom PCB design ("GlowBand v1.0"). The PCB design is still in development, but I plan to finish the design in the coming months. Stay tuned!
